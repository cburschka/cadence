cadence
=======

cadence is a JavaScript-based web client for XMPP Multi-User Chat
powered by strophe.js.

Requirements
------------

* An XMPP server with Multi-User Chat and either BOSH or WebSocket
  support is required to run cadence.
* Python 2.7+ (or 3+) and GNU Make are required in the build process.
* Optional JS and CSS compression uses the YUI Compressor utility.
  Install it using your distribution's package manager or download
  it here: https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/releases

Building
--------

### Configuration

First, run the configure script. The script can be executed from any
location outside the source directory ("out-of-source") or directly inside
("in source").

These arguments are supported:

```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --secure          Generate HTTPS or Secure WebSocket URLs
  --domain DOMAIN       XMPP domain to log in on.
  --url URL             BOSH or WebSocket URL to connect to [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT/PATH]
  --protocol            The protocol to connect through [http, https, ws, wss].
  --host                The host to connect to, if it differs from the XMPP domain [DOMAIN]
  --port                The port to connect to [5280, 5281].
  --path                The socket path on the server to connect to [/http-bind or /websocket].
  --session-auth AUTH   The URL to use for session authentication.
  --muc MUC             The MUC conference server to connect to. [conference.DOMAIN]
  --chatbot CHATBOT     The displayed name of the virtual ChatBot. ["Info"]
  --title TITLE         The page title. ["cadence"]
  --style STYLE         The default style. ["Stygium"]
  --cdn-url CDN_URL     Base URL for resources. (Optional)
  --prefix PREFIX       Directory to install cadence to ["."]
  --cdn-prefix CDN_PREFIX
                        Directory to install resources to [PREFIX]
  --mode debug|aggregate|minify
                        Whether to optimize JS/CSS files ["minify"]
```

* Only `--domain` is strictly required. `--muc` and `--url` are required if
  they differ from the default values.

* `--session-auth` is required if you would like to hook into an existing site's login
  system via [ejabberd-auth-php](https://github.com/cburschka/ejabberd-auth-php). It is
  the public URL of the `rpc.php` script in that software's session authentication plugin.

* `--chatbot` and `--title` merely affect the client branding.

* The `--prefix` is required to cleanly deploy the application to a directory.
  (An in-source build is a functional installation, but an out-of-source build must
  be installed before use, because static resources are not copied to the build location.)

* The `--cdn-prefix` and `cdn-url` options are used to deploy the application's resources
  to a CDN. If this is given, all but the index.html file are deployed there.
  (You can also use the CDN for index.html file with `--prefix`, but this will make
  the application harder to find, and will break session-authentication due to
  cross-site security policies.

The `--mode` determines whether to aggregate and minify the scripts and stylesheets.
For development, "debug" is recommended.

### Make

Then simply execute the Makefile.

    $ make && make install

Customizing the Settings
------------------------

It is not recommended to edit `js/core/config.js` (if this file even exists, and has
not been aggregated and minified), because it will be overwritten if the software
is rebuilt from source.

Instead, the installer places a file named `config.custom.js` into the install directory
along with your index.html file. Add any configuration changes to this file
by assigning or deleting keys in the global `config` object.
