cadence
=======

cadence is a JavaScript-based web client for XMPP Multi-User Chat
powered by strophe.js.

Requirements
------------

* An XMPP server with Multi-User Chat and either BOSH or WebSocket
  support is required to run cadence.
* Python 3+, [Babel](https://babeljs.io) and GNU Make are
  required in the build process.

Building
--------

### Configuration

First, create your configuration file from the template in `install.dist.yml`.

#### configure.py

The `configure.py` script will create this file automatically, but editing it
manually allows additional configuration.

```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --secure          Generate HTTPS or Secure WebSocket URLs
  --domain DOMAIN       XMPP domain to log in on.
  --muc MUC             The MUC conference server to connect to. [conference.DOMAIN]
  --url URL             BOSH or WebSocket URL to connect to [PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT/PATH]
  --protocol            The protocol to connect through [http, https, ws, wss].
  --host                The host to connect to, if it differs from the XMPP domain [DOMAIN]
  --port                The port to connect to [5280, 5281].
  --path                The socket path on the server to connect to [/http-bind or /websocket].
  --session-auth AUTH   The URL to use for session authentication.
  --profile PROFILE     The installation profile to create or update [install.yml].
```

* Only `--domain` is strictly required. `--muc` and `--url` are required if
  they differ from the default values.

* `--session-auth` is required if you would like to hook into an existing site's login
  system via [ejabberd-auth-php](https://github.com/cburschka/ejabberd-auth-php). It is
  the public URL of the `rpc.php` script in that software's session authentication plugin.

If the installation profile already exists, it will be updated.

#### Manual configuration

After running `configure.py` (or copying `install.dist.yml` to `install.yml`)
you can customize the configuration further.

The `config` key is merged into the default configuration that is defined in
`config/default.yml`. All values there may be overridden here.

The `install` key contains several directives for the setup scripts:

* `target` and `cdn.target` designate directories where the files will be installed.
  These are optional; the build directory is already a functional installation.

* `styles` and `packs` define the stylesheets and emoticon packs. This list is
  automatically generated from the contents of `assets/css/alt` and `emoticon-packs`.

### Make

After configuring, simply execute the Makefile.

    $ make && make install

To build from a custom profile:

    $ make profile=<profile.yml> && make install

The profile otherwise defaults to the most recent one used, or `install.yml`.
